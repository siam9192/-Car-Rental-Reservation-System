        You may cancel your rental reservation free of charge up to 24 hours before the scheduled pickup time. To cancel, please use our online cancellation tool or contact our customer service team at [contact information].

Cancellations made within 24 hours of the pickup time will incur a fee of 20% of the total rental cost. This fee will be charged to the original payment method.

If you do not pick up the vehicle and do not notify us, you will be charged the full rental amount. This includes cases where you miss your pickup time without prior communication.

For prepaid reservations, cancellations made within 24 hours of the pickup time will also incur a 20% fee of the total rental cost. Refunds for prepaid reservations will be processed back to the original payment method and may take up to 7 business days.

If you need to modify your reservation, such as changing the pickup time or location, please contact us at least 24 hours before the pickup. Modifications are subject to availability and may involve additional fees.
